  'Anthony Chi-Thanh Pham': `I still crack up when I think about you, my brother. Mating fish, having a BM at the same exact time every day before track practice, pulling ladies long before Tom and I. You were a great friend to have.

Running track with you was an absolute blast. Playing the lightsabre finger-pointing game, gossiping and joking, making fun of each other. You were an integral part of a lot of the good wholesome fun I had in high school.

I learned a lot from you, too. I could never have imagined a family like yours until you exposed me to it. A different culture than I knew existed in my little world of Grand Rapids, Michigan. I loved driving you home and getting little glimpses into your life.

I seem to recall giving you shit for wearing that necklace that said something about if you're wearing this when you die then you'll have a better chance of going to heaven or something. Know that now, I have a lot of respect and admiration for you for wearing that. Looking back, I think it signified a knowledge of and trust in God that you had that I did not. Seeing you wear it everyday helped me feel more comfortable making decisions based on my faith and spiritual beliefs, which I'd always been scared to do for fear of judgment.

Thank you, Chi Thanh for teaching me so much, being such a wonderful friend, and sharing so many good times! I hope you're doing well and would be curious to hear what you're up to these days.

Love,
Cash

  'Sa√πl Arciel Cardiel-Lopez': `You were hands down the most generous, welcoming, and joyous friend I'd ever had. Always down to hang out, hooking us up with a ride and a place to crash, facilitating the most fun and memorable times of my teenage years.

I remember Freshman year when you invited me over for a pool party after we'd only met like a week before. I was so confused why you'd invited me because I'd never been included in an invitation like that. I felt a lot of nervousness and anxiety leading up to coming over to your house and it was a really big deal for me but you made it seem so natural. You were so inclusive and confident it would be fun that despite my fear, declining or backing out was never an option. I was excited because of your infectious nature.

The recurrences of this sort of situation are too many to count. And I'm sure I'm not alone in feeling this way- you surely got a lot of people out of their comfort zones and forced them to grow, to discover the joy waiting on the other side of their fear. For better or worse... because of course pushing limits involves finding them every now and then.

It always seemed like you had a secret, an air of mystery about you. And you were intelligent, good-looking, and confident enough to pull it off. I looked up to you and highly respected you. Your personality was infectious and I could see I wasn't the only one infected by it, which made it all the more appealing. I still don't understand how you managed to do the things you did like hook up with girls, have fancy electronics, know about house parties, etc. In my eyes you were the fuckin' man.

Thank you for making every moment spent with you a joyful experience, Sa√πl. I still look up to you for your optimism, confidence, and passion for living life to the fullest. I am glad to still call you a close friend all these years later. Even though we don't talk regularly, I feel confident we can pick right back up where we left off whenever we need each other.

Love,
Cash

  'Michael Timothy Baldwin': `Of all the people in my life during high school, I looked up to you the most. I know you'll cringe at me saying this but I thought you had the most perfect life. A loving family, an outgoing, fun-loving, and hilarious personality, mad soccer skills, incredible intelligence, and unparalleled work ethic. You were the whole package. _Are_ the whole package!

I remember going over to your house one night after school and doing homework together in your basement. Immediately after we arrived you grabbed us a healthy snack out of the fridge and proceeded downstairs to start on homework. Your desire to get work done seemed to come to you so naturally! Never dilly-dallying by the fridge full of ice cream, never pausing to question if some video games wouldn't hurt. You were just on top of things. But you also knew when and how to have fun; putting the same thoughtfulness and focus into play as you did work.

Fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on the event üòà), we usually had the same idea of a good time. Out of everyone I've known in my life, I would say that I have the most shared experience with you. Studying Computer Science, doing Hacker Fellows, leaving jobs, future wives, and mainstream society in search of something greater... we've really been on similar trajectories. It's such a pleasure to be flying along on this path and be able to look to the side and see you right there with me. It's comforting and reassuring. And hilarious- God sure does have a sense of humor!

Some of my favorites memories of you are: wearing our morph suits together (dirty hippie, MSU, Marco Island), watching you dance, seeing you get fired up (in anger or passion), observing your tendency to go all in. And so many more.

You are the closest I've ever felt to having a brother. Thank you for all the laughs, all the inspiration to be a better person, and all the shared experience. I would not have had even remotely the amount of fun that I did from ages 14-24 without you. I look forward to sharing more laughs and conversations about God with you in the future.

Love,
Cash

  'Andre Alexander Cargill': `It's hard for me to remember how you were different from when we first met versus now because in many ways it feels like you've stayed the same. You are still the greatest friend anyone could ask for, selflessly giving all of yourself to those you love. I am honored to call myself your friend and someone who has received that love for over 14 years straight now.

It took me a long time to understand you because I'd never met someone as resolute and convicted in their loyalties as you. Loyal to family, friends, and yourself; to your beliefs. Things that are questions for others are never questions for you. Your unwavering selflessness, the respect you have for others, and your desire to be of service to those in need is inspiring and humbling. Humbling because it is so painfully obvious you would die for a loved one in an instant. How can one not be humbled in the midst of that sort of sacrifice? You are truly one of a kind, a man out of a fairy tale, and I am so grateful to call you my friend. True gratitude has a feeling of unworthiness, of disbelief that one could be so fortunate. And that is how I feel about having you in my life in such a big way for all these years.

I will always be there for you as I know you will be there for me. Thank you for setting the example because I don't think I would be strong enough to without it.

You surely have touched others lives in similar ways as you've touched mine and are destined to touch many more. I can't wait to hear all the stories of you using your gifts to heal others that I'm sure are to come.

You are a weasel, Andre. Something wild lives inside of you and I'm so happy you continue to hold onto it. To listen to it and follow it. I'm not surprised though, it is your nature.

Love,
Cash

Dillard, Annie. ‚ÄúLiving Like Weasels‚Äù

A weasel is wild. Who knows what he thinks? He sleeps in his underground den, his tail draped over his nose. Sometimes he lives in his den for two days without leaving. Outside, he stalks rabbits, mice, muskrats, and birds, killing more bodies than he can eat warm, and often dragging the carcasses home. Obedient to instinct, he bites his prey at the neck, either splitting the jugular vein at the throat or crunching the brain at the base of the skull, and he does not let go. One naturalist refused to kill a weasel who was socketed into his hand deeply as a rattlesnake. The man could in no way pry the tiny weasel off, and he had to walk half a mile to water, the weasel dangling from his palm, and soak him off like a stubborn label.  

And once, says Ernest Thompson Seton‚Äîonce, a man shot an eagle out of the sky. He examined the eagle and found the dry skull of a weasel fixed by the jaws to his throat. The supposition is that the eagle had pounced on the weasel and the weasel swiveled and bit as instinct taught him, tooth to neck, and nearly won. I would like to have seen that eagle from the air a few weeks or months before he was shot: was the whole weasel still attached to his feathered throat, a fur pendant? Or did the eagle eat what he could reach, gutting the living weasel with his talons before his breast, bending his beak, cleaning the beautiful airborne bones?  

I have been reading about weasels because I saw one last week. I startled a weasel who startled me, and we exchanged a long glance.  

Twenty minutes from my house, through the woods by the quarry and across the highway, is Hollins Pond, a remarkable piece of shallowness, where I like to go at sunset and sit on a tree trunk. Hollins Pond is also called Murray's Pond; it covers two acres of bottomland near Tinker Creek with six inches of water and six thousand lily pads. In winter, brown-and-white steers stand in the middle of it, merely dampening their hooves; from the distant shore they look like miracle itself, complete with miracle's nonchalance. Now, in summer, the steers are gone. The water lilies have blossomed and spread to a green horizontal plane that is terra firma to plodding blackbirds, and tremulous ceiling to black leeches, crayfish, and carp.  

This is, mind you, suburbia. It is a five-minute walk in three directions to rows of houses, though none is visible here. There's a 55 mph highway at one end of the pond, and a nesting pair of wood ducks at the other. Under every bush is a muskrat hole or a beer can. The far end is an alternating series of fields and woods, fields and woods, threaded everywhere with motorcycle tracks‚Äîin whose bare clay wild turtles lay eggs.  

So. I had crossed the highway, stepped over two low barbed-wire fences, and traced the motorcycle path in all gratitude through the wild rose and poison ivy of the pond's shoreline up into high grassy fields. Then I cut down through the woods to the mossy fallen tree where I sit. This tree is excellent. It makes a dry, upholstered bench at the upper, marshy end of the pond, a plush jetty raised from the thorny shore between a shallow blue body of water and a deep blue body of sky.  

The sun had just set. I was relaxed on the tree trunk, ensconced in the lap of lichen, watching the lily pads at my feet tremble and part dreamily over the thrusting path of a carp. A yellow bird appeared to my right and flew behind me. It caught my eye; I swiveled around‚Äîand the next instant, inexplicably, I was looking down at a weasel, who was looking up at me.  

Weasel! I'd never seen one wild before. He was ten inches long, thin as a curve, a muscled ribbon, brown as fruitwood, soft-furred, alert. His face was fierce, small and pointed as a lizard's; he would have made a good arrowhead. There was just a dot of chin, maybe two brown hairs' worth, and then the pure white fur began that spread down his underside. He had two black eyes I didn't see, any more than you see a window.  

The weasel was stunned into stillness as he was emerging from beneath an enormous shaggy wild rose bush four feet away. I was stunned into stillness twisted backward on the tree trunk. Our eyes locked, and someone threw away the key.  

Our look was as if two lovers, or deadly enemies, met unexpectedly on an overgrown path when each had been thinking of something else: a clearing blow to the gut. It was also a bright blow to the brain, or a sudden beating of brains, with all the charge and intimate grate of rubbed balloons. It emptied our lungs. It felled the forest, moved the fields, and drained the pond; the world dismantled and tumbled into that black hole of eyes. If you and I looked at each other that way, our skulls would split and drop to our shoulders. But we don't. We keep our skulls. So.  

He disappeared. This was only last week, and already I don't remember what shattered the enchantment. I think I blinked, I think I retrieved my brain from the weasel's brain, and tried to memorize what I was seeing, and the weasel felt the yank of separation, the careening splash-down into real life and the urgent current of instinct. He vanished under the wild rose. I waited motionless, my mind suddenly full of data and my spirit with pleadings, but he didn't return.  

Please do not tell me about "approach-avoidance conflicts." I tell you I've been in that weasel's brain for sixty seconds, and he was in mine. Brains are private places, muttering through unique and secret tapes‚Äîbut the weasel and I both plugged into another tape simultaneously, for a sweet and shocking time. Can I help it if it was a blank? 

What goes on in his brain the rest of the time? What does a weasel think about? He won't say. His journal is tracks in clay, a spray of feathers, mouse blood and bone: uncollected, unconnected, loose leaf, and blown.  

I would like to learn, or remember, how to live. I come to Hollins Pond not so much to learn how to live as, frankly, to forget about it. That is, I don't think I can learn from a wild animal how to live in particular--shall I suck warm blood, hold my tail high, walk with my footprints precisely over the prints of my hands?--but I might learn something of mindlessness, something of the purity of living in the physical sense and the dignity of living without bias or motive. The weasel lives in necessity and we live in choice, hating necessity and dying at the last ignobly in its talons. I would like to live as I should, as the weasel lives as he should. And I suspect that for me the way is like the weasel's: open to time and death painlessly, noticing everything, remembering nothing, choosing the given with a fierce and pointed will.  

I missed my chance. I should have gone for the throat. I should have lunged for that streak of white under the weasel's chin and held on, held on through mud and into the wild rose, held on for a dearer life. We could live under the wild rose wild as weasels, mute and uncomprehending. I could very calmly go wild. I could live two days in the den, curled, leaning on mouse fur, sniffing bird bones, blinking, licking, breathing musk, my hair tangled in the roots of grasses. Down is a good place to go, where the mind is single. Down is out, out of your ever-loving mind and back to your careless senses. I remember muteness as a prolonged and giddy fast, where every moment is a feast of utterance received. Time and events are merely poured, unremarked, and ingested directly, like blood pulsed into my gut through a jugular vein. Could two live that way? Could two live under the wild rose, and explore by the pond, so that the smooth mind of each is as everywhere present to the other, and as received and as unchallenged, as falling snow?  

We could, you know. We can live any way we want. People take vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience‚Äîeven of silence‚Äîby choice. The thing is to stalk your calling in a certain skilled and supple way, to locate the most tender and live spot and plug into that pulse. This is yielding, not fighting. A weasel doesn't "attack" anything; a weasel lives as he's meant to, yielding at every moment to the perfect freedom of single necessity.  

I think it would be well, and proper, and obedient, and pure, to grasp your one necessity and not let it go, to dangle from it limp wherever it takes you. Then even death, where you're going no matter how you live, cannot you part. Seize it and let it seize you up aloft even, till your eyes burn out and drop; let your musky flesh fall off in shreds, and let your very bones unhinge and scatter, loosened over fields, over fields and woods, lightly, thoughtless, from any height at all, from as high as eagles.

  'Jose Antonio Arreola': `You are a high quality homie. Always calm cool and collected, you ooze chillness. That chillness is infectious and was an integral part of the feeder squad's ability to have a good time.

Your presence was always welcome. I could never imagine a situation where I wouldn't want you around. Loud dance parties, chill vape sessions, intimate 1:1 conversations- Jose can fit in anywhere, converse with anyone, and be cool no matter what the situation. A sort of stoic temperament that I greatly respected and attempted to mimic despite my internal feelings of nervousness. You are a cool dude and it seems to come very naturally to you.

I remember meeting you at your car one time and greeting you through the driver's window while you sat. I tried to lean in through the window in a bro-hug motion and failed. You laughed and said something like, "why'd you do it so awkward?". I feel this interaction exemplifies traits you have in abundance- an ability to diffuse potentially awkward situations with a non-judgmental and humorous attitude that makes even the most self-conscious and awkward feel at ease.

I always wanted to get to know you better. I felt like there was a lot going on behind the scenes with you that I craved seeing. I probably spent hundreds of hours hanging out with you, yet I don't your siblings names, what your parents do for a living, or what your aspirations were after graduating from GVSU. I feel like if I asked you these things you'd tell me in a reserved, matter-of-fact way, with no ego. Just a humble reservedness that is admirable and easy to be around.

I hope to see you in person sometime soon whether it's me in Michigan or you on the West Coast. Thank you for being a good friend, Jose. Someone you can always count on to show up and have a good time. I still hope to learn more about who the behind the scenes Jose is.

Love,
Cash
