          So instead of people listening to a meditation on YouTube or an app,
          they join a live zoom ?
        </H2>
        Yes, exactly! Just to offer more accountability for showing up and
        practicing. I find if I sign up for something in advance and there's
        others attending with me, I'm much more likely to actually do it.

      <H2>Is the intention an ongoing group of the same people?</H2>
      <p>
        An ongoing group of the same people would be great but not necessarily
        the intention. It depends on peoples schedules and stuff. I want there
        to be some exposure to new people, like my Michigan family meeting my
        California friends and being exposed to new ways of life and thinking
